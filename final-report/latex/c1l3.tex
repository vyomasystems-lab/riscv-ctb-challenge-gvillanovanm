\section{Challenge 1 Level 3 (C1L3): Infinite Loop Caused by Illegal Instruction Exception}

This challenge, which consists of an infinite loop caused by an exception, is described below as well as its solution.

\subsection{Cause}

In the given code (Listing \ref{lst:c1l3}), an exception is intentionally created by executing an illegal instruction (code = 2). The trap is treated in the \texttt{mtvec\_handler} function; it's presented in Listing \ref{lst:c1l3_handle}. The issue arises from only checking the fail condition (\texttt{bne t0, t1, fail}) but never checking the pass condition. The effect of this is that the instruction \texttt{mret} will return the program counter (PC) to the last instruction, which is illegal, resulting in an infinite loop.

\begin{listing}[h]
\caption{Snippet to cause an illegal instruction exception.}
\label{lst:c1l3}
\begin{minted}[frame=single]{nasm}
illegal_instruction:
  .word 0              
  j fail
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}[h]
\caption{Handle to illegal instruction exception.}
\label{lst:c1l3_handle}
\begin{minted}[frame=single]{nasm}
mtvec_handler:
  li t1, CAUSE_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION
  csrr t0, mcause
  bne t0, t1, fail
  csrr t0, mepc

  mret
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

\subsection{Solution}

To fix the bug and avoid the infinite loop, it is necessary to add the instruction \texttt{beq t0, t1, pass} before or after the \texttt{bne t0, t1, fail} instruction. This will ensure that if the pass condition is met, the program proceeds to the \texttt{pass} label, thus preventing the infinite loop. The corrected code is presented in Listing \ref{lst:c1l3_fix}

\begin{listing}[h]
\caption{Fix Listing \ref{lst:c1l3}.}
\label{lst:c1l3_fix}
\begin{minted}[frame=single]{nasm}
  li t1, CAUSE_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION
  csrr t0, mcause
  bne t0, t1, fail
  beq t0, t1, pass # new inst. added
  csrr t0, mepc
  mret
\end{minted}
\end{listing}

With this modification, the code will properly check both the fail and pass conditions, preventing the infinite loop and resolving the bug.
